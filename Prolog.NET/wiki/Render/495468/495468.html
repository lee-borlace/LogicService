<div class="wikidoc"><h1>And now, a word from our sponsor...</h1>Hello all!  <br /><br />After a rather lengthy hiatus, I&#39;ve returned to focus some attention on this project.  Much of the project-related delay involved reworking the logic for bagof and adding support for eval.  (I won&#39;t bore you with the non-project-related reasons...)  I hope the new implementation is closer to that of other Prolog implementations such as GNU Prolog.<br /><br />My next focus will be on addressing suggestions and issues I&#39;ve received, and enhancements to allow Prolog.NET to be more easily integrated with other .NET applications.<br /><br />Thank you again for your interest and patience!<br />
<h1>Project Description</h1>A .NET-base implementation of Prolog based on the Warren Abstract Machine &#40;WAM&#41; architecture.<br /><br />This project contains:
<ul><li>Prolog - the primary assembly containing the Prolog.NET compiler and interpreter.</li>
<li>PrologLibrary - an assembly containing external functions callable by Prolog.NET programs.</li>
<li>PrologSchedule - a WPF application demonstrating the use of Prolog.NET from a client C# application.</li>
<li>PrologTest - a console application used for testing.</li>
<li>PrologWorkbench - a WPF application used for editing, running and debugging Prolog.NET programs.</li></ul>

<h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>Please see <a href="https://prolog.codeplex.com/documentation?referringTitle=Home">Documentation</a> page for additional information about Prolog.NET.</li>
<li>The project source code currently contains TFS source control bindings.  These bindings should be removed if you have not installed the Visual Studio Team Explorer.</li></ul>

<h2>Project Status</h2>This project is under active development.<br />
