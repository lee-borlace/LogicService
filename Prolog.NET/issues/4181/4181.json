    "Description": "It may be that this Prolog.NET isn't designed to do what I'm asking it to do, so maybe this issue gets deleted or moved to discussions.\n \nAnyhow, I have a netbook running XP SP3 with latest patches, including .NET framework versions 2.0 and 3.5 (and probably 1.1) with latest patches. I have successfully installed VS 2008 Express on it (C#). Installed Prolog.NET\n \nMy idea was to use the Prolog.NET Workbench to do some hobby-level Prolog programming on that box. But when I invoke it I get a dialog box \"Prolog.NET Workbench has encountered a problem and needs to close.\" The error details are:\n \nEventType : clr20r3     P1 : prolog.workbench.exe     P2 : 1.0.4.0     \nP3 : 4b9b379c     P4 : microsoft.windowsapicodepack     P5 : 1.0.0.0     \nP6 : 4b1c1094     P7 : 1e7     P8 : 15     P9 : system.platformnotsupported\n \nThe exe properties say it's version 1.0.4.0, which I see in \"P2\" above.",

      "Message": "There is a combination of issues here.  I should be handling the PlatformNotSupport exception properly under XP when attempt to display a TaskDialog.  However, fixing that reveals the underlying issue: the icon format I've used for the program is not supported by Windows XP.  I am working on a resolution to both these problems and will have a fix posted within a day or so.  Thank you for your feedback and patience!",
